## This is a guid on how to use our swagger ui documentation

## Important Note:

    in order to open our swagger UI documentation
    *step 1 : you need to clone our repository. -> (url : "https://github.com/SD-0224/backend-final-3.git")
    *step 2 : run it using "npm start"
    *step 3 : the swagger UI documentation will be available on "http://localhost:3000/api-docs/"

## Must Read! :

    our swagger is ready and working perfectly and providing all the models and all the endpoints with the proper description
    we faced an issue in making it work using our deployed link, when we use our deployed link the swagger ui page does indeed open,
    it just doesnt have our models and endpoints presented for some reason,
    sadly we didnt have enough time to troubleshoot this, probably it needs some kind of configuration that we havent found out how to do yet.
